The Hack Computer is a theoretical computer designed and created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schoken .They described in their book, The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles. It is a digital, binary machine that is created according to the von Neumann architecture model. Codes in Nanad2tetris are written in classes like as we do in Java. Finally, we get a hack computer with main part 16-bit Hack CPU and coming to the second part of our project we will be designing a synchronous up/down counter otherwise called as bidirectional counter using JK flip flop.


Oops

The design of all the constituent elements such as logic gates, multiway chips, Multiplexers, Adders, Program counter, Register, etc., are made from NAND gates.
The constituent elements that are required to design hack CPU are Nand gate, Not gate, And gate, Or gate, And16, Not16,Or16, Or8way, Mux, Mux16, Half adder, Full adder, Add16, ALU, Bit register, 16-bit register, Program counter. The functionality of these gates are built in java and will be getting an output for corresponding input.




Questions were divided into two parts answered accordingly

Part-A

Design and implement 16 bit HACK CPU (common to all groups)
–
As a part of this project, the team is expected to study the architecture of a general purpose central processing unit and how it can be programmed/implemented in hardware description language and Object Oriented language
–
The design of all the constituent elements such as logic gates, multiway chips, Multiplexers, Adders, Program counter, Register, etc must be made from NAND gates
–
Eoc
• The implementation must be shown in the Hack Platform Moreover, the CPU built must be shown as a part of the Hack computer and tested using machine level programs
–
 Object Oriented Programming
•
The constituent elements of the Hack CPU must be implemented in JAVA, starting from the implementation of NAND gates, calling all constituent elements as per the architecture, and finally delivering the functionality of CPU You must give an input bit sequence and show the corresponding output 2


Part-B

As a part of this project, the team is expected to study the design of
the digital logic systems and how it can be programmed/implemented
in hardware description language and Object Oriented language

Design and implement synchronous UP/DOWN counter circuit using JK Flip flops (up counting from 0 to 15 and downcounting 15 to 0 based on a control input)

EOC 1

•The implementation must be shown in the Hack Platform Built in chips should not be used in any implementations
except the D flip flop However, improvisation in any other platforms like CircuitVerse Falstad etc is allowed


Object Oriented Programming

• The constituent elements of the design should be made from NAND gates The functionality of the design should be shown as a JAVA program You must
give an input bit sequence and show the corresponding output, wherever applicable
