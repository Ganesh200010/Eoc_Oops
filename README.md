The Hack Computer is a theoretical computer designed and created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schoken .They described in their book, The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles. It is a digital, binary machine that is created according to the von Neumann architecture model. Codes in Nanad2tetris are written in classes like as we do in Java. Finally, we get a hack computer with main part 16-bit Hack CPU and coming to the second part of our project we will be designing a synchronous up/down counter otherwise called as bidirectional counter using JK flip flop.


Oops

The design of all the constituent elements such as logic gates, multiway chips, Multiplexers, Adders, Program counter, Register, etc., are made from NAND gates.
The constituent elements that are required to design hack CPU are Nand gate, Not gate, And gate, Or gate, And16, Not16,Or16, Or8way, Mux, Mux16, Half adder, Full adder, Add16, ALU, Bit register, 16-bit register, Program counter. The functionality of these gates are built in java and will be getting an output for corresponding input.
